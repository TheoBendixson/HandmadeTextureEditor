# Handmade Texture Editor (Mac Only)

## What is this tool?
It's a keyboard and game pad controlled graphics editor I threw together for a 2D sprite-based game I'm building. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles (lol you literally can't give it a sprite size yet. It just defaults to 24 by 24), but it's useful, and it might help someone else who is looking to make thier own graphics editor or someone who is simply interested in learning how graphics work on a modern computer.

## What files does it read? What files does it write?
For now, the tool only understands its own files (.pgtn). This file type specifies the width, height, and an offset into the pixel buffer. I have intentionally kept this simple so I can focus on making art for a game. I didn't want to dive into reading PNG files becuase my game doesn't have an artist other than myself yet, so I figured it would be a waste of time (for the moment).

Mabye it will support PNGs in the future. Maybe it won't. I have no idea.

## Can I use this for my own project?
Absolutely. I'm putting this up on the Internet so people can do with it as they please. You can use it as a base for a graphics editor of your own making.

I just ask that if you found this code useful, please become one of my sponsors! I could use the help.

## Can I contribute to this project?
No, but you can copy it and do whatever you want with that.

I'm not taking contributors because I don't really intend for this to become a general-purpose graphics editing tool. I want to keep it as simple as possible for the projects I'm working on. If it starts to support too many features, it will become clunky and difficult to understand and use.
